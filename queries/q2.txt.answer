This database included lower and upper air measurements from weather stations, along with hourly readings of surface temperature, humidity, and wind speed from air pollution stations. The goal was to construct a function f(x) that could accurately predict the next day's ozone level (y) based on the predictor vector x of meteorological variables. The first five years of data were used as a training set, and the last two years were used as a test set. The author notes that the algorithmic modeling methods available in the pre-1980s seem primitive now. Large linear regressions were run, followed by variable selection. Quadratic terms and interactions among the retained variables were added, and variable selection was used again to prune the equations. However, the project was ultimately a failure due to a high false alarm rate. The author regrets that the project can't be revisited with the tools available today (Manuscript_Two_Cultures.pdf).\n\nThe author's perceptions on statistical analysis, formed after consulting on projects like the ozone project, included:\n(a) Focus on finding a good solution.\n(b) Live with the data before modeling.\n(c) Search for a model that gives a good solution, either algorithmic or data.\n(d) Predictive accuracy on test sets is the criterion for how good the model is.\n(e) Computers are an indispensable partner (Manuscript_Two_Cultures.pdf).", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019afead-7e03-7913-805b-9b49dd649aa6-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2719, 'output_tokens': 310, 'total_tokens': 3029, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]}
