A common data model is: response variables = f(predictor variables, random noise, parameters). The parameters are estimated from the data and the model is used for information and/or prediction (see manuscript). The author estimates that 98% of all statisticians fall into this category (see manuscript).\n*   **The Algorithmic Modeling Culture:** This approach considers the inside of the box complex and unknown and aims to find an algorithm f(x) that operates on x to predict the responses y (see manuscript). Model validation is measured by predictive accuracy (see manuscript). The author estimates that only 2% of statisticians are in this culture, with many practitioners residing in other fields (see manuscript).', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b1293-df23-79b1-9cbe-6b9def1c4303-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2546, 'output_tokens': 200, 'total_tokens': 2746, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]}
